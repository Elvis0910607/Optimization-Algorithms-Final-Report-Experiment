# Optimization Algorithms Comparison: SGD, SVRG, and STORC
This repository contains an implementation and comparison of three optimization algorithms: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Stochastic Variance-Reduced Gradient (SVRG), and the STORC (STOchastic variance-Reduced Conditional gradient sliding) algorithm as introduced in the paper "Variance-Reduced and Projection-Free Stochastic Optimization" by Hazan and Luo.
